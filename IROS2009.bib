	Abstract = {In the area of autonomous multi-robot cooperation, much emphasis has been placed on how to coordinate individual robot behaviors in order to achieve an optimal solution to task completion as a team. This paper presents an approach to cooperative multi-robot reinforcement learning based on a hybrid state space representation of the environment to achieve both task learning and heterogeneous role emergence in a unified framework. The methodology also involves learning space reduction through a neural perception module and a progressive rescheduling algorithm that interleaves online execution and relearning to adapt to environmental uncertainties and enhance performance. The approach aims to reduce combinatorial complexity inherent in role-task optimization, and achieves a satisfying solution to complex team-based tasks, rather than a globally optimal solution. Empirical evaluation of the proposed framework is conducted through simulation of a foraging task.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses a flexible cooperative navigation system for small robot teams. The members of these groups move in formation, but with enough flexibility to be able to avoid obstacles and adapt to the environment shape. This approach is based on an analysis of the environment on a grid-based model that permits each robot to continuously evaluate the situation in which it is, in order to decide the best of the three developed navigation strategies, one for each situation type. Moreover, by using this model the robot cooperation for a coordinate navigation is improved, allowing each robot to share the observations with the other robots. So the field of view of each robot of the team on which it makes the decisions is enlarged. The system is implemented in a decentralized way so the number of robots is not a main issue, thus being scalable. Eventually, initial formation topology can be modified, in order to comply with the environment while the mission is accomplished. The system and the strategies are evaluated by means of simulations, showing the robustness against possible blocking situations.},

	Abstract = {The goal of a robot formation control architecture is to get a number of robots into a specified form. To be effective and practical, the control architecture must be able to transition a group of robots from an initial swarm to a final formation. It must then be able to handle real-world events that could disrupt the formation, thus, requiring formation repair, obstacle avoidance, and changes in the formation. In previous work, we presented a distributed, reactive cellular automata-based formation control architecture capable of controlling any number of robots in formation at once. In this paper, we examine our architecture with respect to necessary characteristics to handle real-world occurrences. To address issues of formation repair and obstacle avoidance, the control architecture is extended by a distributed auctioning method that allows the robot formation to reconfigure autonomously.},

	Abstract = {In multi-robot systems, task allocation and coordination are two fundamental problems that share high synergy. Although multi-robot architectures typically separate them into distinct layers, relevant improvement may be expected from solutions that are able to concurrently handle them at the same {\^A}¿level{\^A}¿. This paper proposes a novel framework, called CoMutaR (coalition formation based on multitasking robots), which is used for both tackle task distribution among teams of mobile robots, and to guarantee the coordination within the formed teams. Robot capabilities are modelled as actions, independent modules whose inputs do not depend on the robot that generated it. Solutions to tasks are devised as coalitions of actions, that can be spread amongst the available robots. We also define the concept of share-restricted resources, which are periodically checked and updated by the actions in the system. In contrast to prior approaches, this mechanism enables to quickly determine if two actions can be executed simultaneously, allowing a single robot to execute multiple tasks concurrently. A single-round auction protocol is used to automatically discover and form coalitions. Once a coalition is formed, coordination among robots is modelled as constraints imposed over the share-restricted resources. Finally, we have successfully implemented and applied CoMutaR in typical scenarios like object transportation, area surveillance, and multi-robot box pushing. Experimental results demonstrate that the system is able to provide good solutions even in the case of severe failures in participating robots.},

	Abstract = {We describe a distributed boundary detection algorithm suitable for use on multi-robot systems with dynamic network topologies. We assume that each robot has access to its local network geometry, which is the combination of a robot's network connectivity and the positions of its neighbors measured relative to itself. Our algorithm uses this information to classify robots as boundary or interior in one communications round, which is fast enough for rapidly changing networks. We use the local boundary classifications to create a robust boundary subgraph, and to determine if the boundary is an interior void or the exterior boundary. A proof of the key property of the boundary detection algorithm is provided, and all the algorithms are extensively tested on a swarm of 25-35 robots in rapidly changing network topologies.},
