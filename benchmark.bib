	which include humans, require rethinking of the benchmarking principles
	for testing these robots. In RoboCup@Home, statistical procedures
	are used to track and steer the progress of domestic service robots
	since 2006. This paper explains the procedures and shows outcomes
	of these international benchmarking efforts. Although aspects such
	as shopping in a supermarket receive a fair amount of attention in
	the robotics community, the authors think that a recently started
	test is the most important outcome of RoboCup@Home, namely the benchmarking
	of robot cognition.},

  abstract = {Being part of the RoboCup initiative, the RoboCup@Home league targets
	the development and deployment of autonomous service and assistive
	robot technology being essential for future personal domestic applications.
	The domain of domestic service and assistive robotics implicates
	a wide range of possible problems. The primary reasons for this include
	the large amount of uncertainty in the dynamic and non-standardized
	environments of the real world, and the related human interaction.
	Furthermore, the application orientation requires a large effort
	towards high level integration combined with a demand for general
	robustness of the systems. This article details the need for interdisciplinary
	community effort to iteratively identify related problems, to define
	benchmarks, to test and, finally, to solve the problems. The concepts
	and the implementation of the RoboCup@Home initiative as a combination
	of scientific exchange and competition is presented as an efficient
	method to accelerate and focus technological and scientific progress
	in the domain of domestic service robots. Finally, the progress in
	terms of performance increase in the benchmarks and technological
	advancements is evaluated and discussed.},
