  abstract = {The "great debate" in cognitive science today is about the nature
	of mental images. One side says images are basically pictures in
	the head. The other side says they are like the symbol structures
	in computers. If the picture-in-the-head theorists are right, then
	computers will never be able to think like people.This book contains
	the most intelligible and incisive articles in the debate, articles
	by cognitive psychologists, computer scientists and philosophers.
	The most exciting imagery phenomena are described, phenomena that
	indicate that mental images can be rotated and scanned, that smaller
	images are harder to see than larger ones, that when mental images
	are made larger they eventually overflow, that the "screen" they
	overflow from has a determinable shape (elliptical), and that this
	"screen" subtends a determinate visual angle, the angle of vision
	of the mind's eye.Such experiments cry out for explanation. If images
	are pictures in the head, who (or what) looks at them? Why haven't
	brain scientists found them? Such questions are the subject of the
	great debate.IMAGERY is an excellent choice for courses in cognitive
	psychology, perception: artificial intelligence, computer science;
	philosophy of mind, of psychology and of science; minds and machines,
	science and society.Contributors include: Roger Brown and Richard
	Herrnstein (on the work of Roger N. Shepard), Daniel Dennett, Jerry
	Fodor, Robert Schwartz, Stephen Kosslyn, Steven Pinker, George Smith,
	Steven Shwartz, and Zenon Pylyshyn},

@BOOK{Johnson-Laird1983,
  title = {Mental Models},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  year = {1983},
  author = {Philip N. Johnson-Laird},
  pages = {513},
  abstract = {Mental Models offers nothing less than a unified theory of the major
	properties of mind, including comprehension, inference, and consciousness.
	In spirited and graceful prose, Johnson-Laird argues that we apprehend
	the world by building inner mental replicas of the relations among
	objects and events that concern us. The mind is essentially a model-building
	device that can itself be modeled on a computer. This book provides
	both a blueprint for building such a model and numerous important
	illustrations of how to do it.},
