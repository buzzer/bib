	Abstract = {: Simulation goals determine the fidelity requirements for cognitive models. We argue that the pursuitof high fidelity cognitive models, unfettered by detailed considerations of what we want the models for, is sounfocused as to be almost useless for practical purposes. What a cognitive model needs to contain is vitallyaffected by what kinds of questions one wishes to answer, i.e., the goals of the simulation. However, there is noreliable and systematic body of knowledge in the simulation community about the demands placed by the goals ofsimulation on models of cognitive (and other) entities. The mappings from simulation goals to fidelity and otherrequirements for cognitive models can be investigated empirically. We outline strategies for how this can be done.1. Fidelity Requirements and SimulationGoalsFidelity, defined as faithfulness to the object or processbeing simulated, usually ranks high among the goalsof simulation researchers and developers.

	Annote = {This paper argues that fidelity considerations are closely connected to the goals for which the simulation is intended, that current research often pursues fidelity independent of the task, and that there is a need to develop a systematic body of knowledge relating simulation tasks to the degree of fidelity required of the models.  The arguments make use of our earlier work on generic tasks and task structures.},
