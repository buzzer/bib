	Abstract = {Mental imagery has, until recently, fallen within the purview of philosophy
	and cognitive
	
	psychology. Both enterprises have raised important questions about
	imagery, but have not made
	
	substantial progress in answering them. With the advent of cognitive
	neuroscience, these
	
	questions have become empirically tractable. Neuroimaging studies,
	combined with other
	
	methods (such as studies of brain-damaged patients and of the effects
	of transcranial magnetic
	
	stimulation), are revealing the ways in which imagery draws on mechanisms
	used in other
	
	activities, such as perception and motor control. Because of its close
	relation to these basic
	
	processes, imagery is now becoming one of the best understood `higher'
	cognitive functions},

	Abstract = {Complex systems are getting to the point where it almost feels as
	if "someone" is there behind the interface. This impression comes
	across most strongly in the field of robotics because these agents
	are physically embodied, much as humans are. We believe that this
	phenomenon has four primary components: a system must be able to
	act in some reasonably complicated domain; communicate with humans
	using a language-like modality;. reason about its actions at some
	level so that it has something to discuss, and, learn and adapt to
	some extent on the basis of human feedback. These aspects are discussed
	in the article.},
