	Abstract = {Multi robot systems are envisioned to play an important role in many robotic applications. A main prerequisite for a team deployed in a wide unknown area is the capability of autonomously navigate, exploiting the information acquired through the on-line estimation of both robot poses and surrounding environment model, according to Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) framework. As team coordination is improved, distributed techniques for filtering are required in order to enhance autonomous exploration and large scale SLAM increasing both efficiency and robustness of operation. Although Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters (RBPF) have been demonstrated to be an effective solution to the problem of single robot SLAM, few extensions to teams of robots exist, and these approaches are characterized by strict assumptions on both communication bandwidth and prior knowledge on relative poses of the teammates. In the present paper we address the problem of multi robot SLAM in the case of limited communication and unknown relative initial poses. Starting from the well established single robot RBPF-SLAM, we propose a simple technique which jointly estimates SLAM posterior of the robots by fusing the prioceptive and the eteroceptive information acquired by each teammate. The approach intrinsically reduces the amount of data to be exchanged among the robots, while taking into account the uncertainty in relative pose measurements. Moreover it can be naturally extended to different communication technologies (bluetooth, RFId, wifi, etc.) regardless their sensing range. The proposed approach is validated through experimental test.},
