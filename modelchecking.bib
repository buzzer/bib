@BOOK{Ben-Ari:2008rr,
  title = {Principles of the Spin Model Checker},
  publisher = {Springer},
  year = {2008},
  author = {Ben-Ari, Mordechai},
  abstract = {The Spin model checker is a widely used professional software tool
	for specifying and verifying concurrent and distributed systems.
	Models, written in a simple language called Promela, can be simulated
	randomly or interactively. Spin can generate efficient verifiers
	that search for a counterexample to correctness specifications applied
	to a model.
	
	Spin is also a superb tool for teaching important concepts of computer
	science such as verification, concurrency and nondeterminism. The
	Promela language is easy to learn, as is the linear temporal logic
	used for correctness specifications, and the techniques for simulating
	and verifying models.
	
	Principles of Spin is an introductory book for students and practicing
	software engineers who wish to learn Promela and Spin. The presentation
	starts with the verification of sequential programs and proceeds
	in gradual stages to the verification of concurrent and then distributed
	programs. Complete programs are used to demonstrate each construct
	and concept, and the source code of these programs, together with
	that of longer case studies, are available on the companion website.
	
	The book describes free software that the author has developed: jSpin---an
	integrated development environment for Spin, SpinSpider---a visualization
	tool that automatically constructs graphical state diagrams of concurrent
	programs, and VN---a Spin-based tool for visualizing nondeterminism
	of finite automata.
	
	Mordechai Ben-Ari is an associate professor in the Department of Science
	Teaching of the Weizmann Institute of Science. He is the author of
	numerous textbooks on concurrency, programming languages and logic,
	and has developed software tools for teaching concurrency. In 2004,
	Ben-Ari received the ACM/SIGCSE Award for Outstanding Contributions
	to Computer Science Education.},

  title = {Java PathFinder A Translator from Java to Promela},
  year = {1999},
  pages = {152},
  abstract = {Java PathFinder [2], Jpf, is a prototype translator from Java to Promela,
	the modeling language of the Spin model checker [4]. Jpf is a product
	of a major effort by the Automated Software Engineering group at
	NASA Ames to make model checking technology part of the software
	process. Experience has shown that severe bugs can be found in final
	code using this technique [1], and that automated translation from
	a programming language to a modeling language like Promela can help
	reducing the effort required. Jpf allows a programmer to annotate
	his Java program with assertions and verify them using the Spin model
	checker. In addition, deadlocks can be identied. An assertion is
	written as a call to an assert method dened in a predened Java class,
	the Verify class. The argument to the method is a boolean Java expression
	over the state variables. The Verify class contains additional tem-
	poral logic methods which allow to state temporal logic properties
	about static variables. Hence Java itself is used as the specication
	language. An application of Jpf is described elsewhere in the proceedings
	[3]. A respectable subset of Java is covered by Jpf, including dynamic
	object cre- ation, object references asrst class citizens, inheritance,
	exceptions, interrupts, and perhaps most importantly: thread operations.
	Among major concepts not translated are: packages, method overloading
	and overriding, method recursion, strings, and floating point numbers.
	Finally, the class library is not translated.},
