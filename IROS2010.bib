	Abstract = {Software for autonomous robots solving challenging tasks in research or application is becoming increasingly complex. System integration has to deal with various different functional components. To decouple those components from each other and to enable a modular and reuseable software architecture a robot middleware is typically used. But this intermediate layer introduces significant additional overhead during run-time. In this work a methodology is described to utilize specific application characteristics to improve communication efficiency between different robot software modules. By composing several components in a single thread memory copying or locking operations can be avoided, when data is exchanged between those parts. The optimization can be  achieved without compromising the advantages of a communication layer. Still the modifications are transparent to the maybe already existing components. Experimental results in the scenario of autonomous soccer-playing humanoid robots are presented and exhibit remarkable reduction in communication overhead. Furthermore this approach can be implemented in or on-top of other communication layers.},

	Abstract = {A cooperation approach with consideration of communication limit is proposed for multi-robot area exploration, in which all the robots select local destinations satisfying the constraints on communication range and reach their destinations at the same time to communicate and fuse their map information. Firstly, the robots compute the frontier between the explored region and the unexplored one. The robots choose the optimal frontier points, which maximize information gain, minimize navigation cost and satisfy communication limit as their local destinations. Then the problem of global exploration in unknown environment is converted into that of multi-stage trajectory planning in local known environment. Collision-free, synchronous and separate trajectories are planned for all the robots to realize the limited communication at their destinations. In such a way, efficient and distributed exploration can be achieved. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of our method.},
