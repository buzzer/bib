  abstract = {Robots are playing an increasingly more important role as the technology
	is maturing. Robots are omnipresent; numerous robots committed to
	a single task will become ordinary. Multi-agent robots are capable
	of handling problems in many different ways than individuals while
	achieving higher levels of performance. But present unique challenges
	for developing collaborative navigation algorithm and coordination
	among themselves are not sufficient for autonomous collaborative
	tasks. Some research papers based on collaborative robots have been
	reviewed in this paper; from review analysis we have developed an
	algorithm with behavioral based distributed knowledge of multi-agents
	for accomplishing collaborative navigation. The goal of multi-agent
	robots is to move as a cohesive team by sharing their distributed
	learning behaviors and navigating in autonomous reconnaissance missions.
	Finally some preliminary experimental results will be presented of
	the developed collaborative navigation algorithm between robots to
	reach the target and achieve their goal sharing their knowledge.},

  month = jun,
  abstract = {{Autonomous robots are intelligent machines capable of performing
	tasks in the world by themselves, without explicit human control.
	Examples range from autonomous helicopters to Roomba, the robot vacuum
	cleaner. In this book, George Bekey offers an introduction to the
	science and practice of autonomous robots that can be used both in
	the classroom and as a reference for industry professionals. He surveys
	the hardware implementations of more than 300 current systems, reviews
	some of their application areas, and examines the underlying technology,
	including control, architectures, learning, manipulation, grasping,
	navigation, and mapping. Living systems can be considered the prototypes
	of autonomous systems, and Bekey explores the biological inspiration
	that forms the basis of many recent developments in robotics. He
	also discusses robot control issues and the design of control architectures.<br
	/> <br /> After an overview of the field that introduces some of
	its fundamental concepts, the book presents background material on
	hardware, control (from both biological and engineering perspectives),
	software architecture, and robot intelligence. It then examines a
	broad range of implementations and applications, including locomotion
	(wheeled, legged, flying, swimming, and crawling robots), manipulation
	(both arms and hands), localization, navigation, and mapping. The
	many case studies and specific applications include robots built
	for research, industry, and the military, among them underwater robotic
	vehicles, walking machines with four, six, and eight legs, and the
	famous humanoid robots Cog, Kismet, ASIMO,"and QRIO. The book concludes
	with reflections on the future of robotics -- the potential benefits
	as well as the possible dangers that may arise from large numbers
	of increasingly intelligent and autonomous robots.}},

	mobile robots should have the capability of taking intelligent decision

	In our paper we proposed a multi agent based architecture which aims
	to utilize mobile agent architecture and distributed computing for
	localization of mobile robots in a low bandwidth network. It involves
	information retrieval from the mobile robots, the information being
	their location in a global map. According to location information
	of each mobile robot, administrator implements low level control
	over mobile robots in their navigation plan and obstacle avoidance
	with the help of communication through mobile agents. This can also
	be done using basic client server architecture, but due to the inherent
	low bandwidth nature of the network, such architectures suffer from
	extreme lagging and network congestion as the number of networks'
	nodes increases, thus making it unsuitable for dynamic exchange of
	information. Hence we are using mobile agent architecture which involves
	transfer of executable code to the location of the data instead of
	transferring data to the location of the executable code.},
