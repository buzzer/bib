	Abstract = {Robots are playing an increasingly more important role as the technology is maturing. Robots are omnipresent; numerous robots committed to a single task will become ordinary. Multi-agent robots are capable of handling problems in many different ways than individuals while achieving higher levels of performance. But present unique challenges for developing collaborative navigation algorithm and coordination among themselves are not sufficient for autonomous collaborative tasks. Some research papers based on collaborative robots have been reviewed in this paper; from review analysis we have developed an algorithm with behavioral based distributed knowledge of multi-agents for accomplishing collaborative navigation. The goal of multi-agent robots is to move as a cohesive team by sharing their distributed learning behaviors and navigating in autonomous reconnaissance missions. Finally some preliminary experimental results will be presented of the developed collaborative navigation algorithm between robots to reach the target and achieve their goal sharing their knowledge.},

	Abstract = {With the progressive growth in the domain of autonomous mobile robot, mobile robots should have the capability of taking intelligent decision for their movement plan. In real time, it should be necessary for mobile robots to consume less amount of energy in navigating also. In our paper we proposed a multi agent based architecture which aims to utilize mobile agent architecture and distributed computing for localization of mobile robots in a low bandwidth network. It involves information retrieval from the mobile robots, the information being their location in a global map. According to location information of each mobile robot, administrator implements low level control over mobile robots in their navigation plan and obstacle avoidance with the help of communication through mobile agents. This can also be done using basic client server architecture, but due to the inherent low bandwidth nature of the network, such architectures suffer from extreme lagging and network congestion as the number of networks' nodes increases, thus making it unsuitable for dynamic exchange of information. Hence we are using mobile agent architecture which involves transfer of executable code to the location of the data instead of transferring data to the location of the executable code.},

We analyze data-driven processing of information performed by an individual robot treated as an agent and we propose to organize it as a set of experts (also treated as agents) exchanging data by means of a blackboard.

	Abstract = {A practical solution for the development of real-world multi-robot applications is presented. It consists of a robot middleware (Player) and a multi-agent development environment (JADE). Such components provide off-the-shelf tools which allow a straightforward implementation of indoor localization and navigation tasks for a team of mobile robots. Such integration combines proven mobile robot algorithms with a distributed infrastructure, and extends the capabilities from a robot alone to a whole team of robots, thus allowing the development of cooperative applications. As a proof of concept, an auction-like goal assignment task is presented: the robot team is given a goal, and each robot proposes an estimated cost for achieving it, then the best proposal is selected. Most of the control flow is automated by the JADE standard interaction protocols. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the advantages of combining both frameworks, for a practical yet sound development of multi-robot applications.},
	Annote = {Basically the same content what I want to write about but with JADE instead of Jadex. A little poor scenarios. I might go into this besides JAdex in more detail.

Most important reference so far I think.
