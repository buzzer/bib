	Abstract = {We propose a local Voronoi decomposition (LVD) algorithm which is able to perform a robust and online task allocation for multiple agents based purely on local information. Because only local information is required in determining each agent's Voronoi region, each agent can then make its decision in a distributive fashion based on its allocated Voronoi region. These Voronoi regions eliminates the occurrence of agents executing instantaneous overlapping tasks. As our method does not require a pre-processing of the map, it is also able to work well in a dynamically changing map with changing number of agents. We will show our proof of concept in the problem of exploration in an unknown environment. In our experimental evaluation, we show that our method significantly outperforms the competing algorithms: Ants algorithm and the Brick amp;Mortar algorithm. Our results also show that our method is near the theoretical best solution.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of communication range limitations for decentralized multi-vehicle mapping. We present a novel integrated communication and planning protocol that enables all vehicles to form a common global map. The fusion of mapping information is facilitated through the Information Filter and performed over a connected acyclic wireless communication network with limited communication range. The formation of the acyclic connected communication network is achieved by partitioning the landmark graph using graph theoretic tools during the planning phase. We provide results that illustrate the effectiveness of our approach over different distributions of landmarks.},

	Abstract = {We present a novel approach to compute collision-free paths for multiple robots subject to local coordination constraints. More specifically, given a set of robots, their initial and final configurations, and possibly some additional coordination constraints, our goal is to compute a collision-free path between the initial and final configuration that maintains the constraints. To solve this problem, our approach generalizes the social potential field method to be applicable to both convex and nonconvex polyhedra. Social potential fields are then integrated into a #x201C;physics-based motion planning #x201D; framework which uses constrained dynamics to solve the motion planning problem. Our approach is able to plan for over 200 robots while averaging about 110 ms per step in a variety of environments.},
