	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a negotiation protocol for simultaneous task subdivision and allocation for heterogeneous multi-robot systems. An abstraction of the concept of task is presented that allows to apply the protocol on a variety of tasks. The negotiation adopts Rubinstein's alternate offers protocol, where offers are evaluated and generated using a heuristic search step. The protocol has been tested on computer simulations.},

	Abstract = {Mobile robots are increasingly entering the real and complex world of humans in ways that necessitate a high degree of interaction and cooperation between human and robot. Complex simulation models, expensive hardware setup, and a highly controlled environment are often required during various stages of robot development. There is a need for robot developers to have a more flexible approach for conducting experiments and to obtain a better understanding of how robots perceive the world. Mixed Reality (MR) presents a world where real and virtual elements co-exist. By merging the real and the virtual in the creation of an MR simulation environment, more insight into the robot behaviour can be gained, e.g. internal robot information can be visualised, and cheaper and safer testing scenarios can be created by making interactions between physical and virtual objects possible. Robot developers are free to introduce virtual objects in an MR simulation environment for evaluating their systems and obtain a coherent display of visual feedback and realistic simulation results. We illustrate our ideas using an MR simulation tool constructed based on the 3D robot simulator Gazebo.},

	Abstract = {Maintaining the network connectivity in mobile Multi-Robot Systems (MRSs) is a key issue in many robotic applications. In our view, the solution to this problem consists of two main steps: (i) making robots aware of the network connectivity; and (ii), making use of this knowledge to plan robots tasks without compromising connectivity. In this paper, we view the ad-hoc network connectivity as an abstraction that is independent from application issues. We propose a new distributed algorithm executing on individual robots to build the connectivity-awareness. The correctness and theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm are given. We also show how our solution allows checking network bi-connectivity more efficiently than existing work and can be used, for example, during distributed control motion.},

	Abstract = {In order to construct three-dimensional shape models of large-scale architectural structures using a laser range finder, a number of range images are taken from various viewpoints. These images are aligned using post-processing procedures such as the ICP algorithm. However, in general, before applying the ICP algorithm, these range images must be aligned roughly by a human operator in order to converge to precise positions. The present paper proposes a new modeling system using a group of multiple robots and an on-board laser range finder. Each measurement position is identified by a highly precise positioning technique called Cooperative Positioning System (CPS), which utilizes the characteristics of the multiple-robot system. Thus, the proposed system can construct 3D shapes of large-scale architectural structures without any post-processing procedure or manual registration. ICP is applied optionally for a subsequent refinement of the model. Measurement experiments in unknown and large indoor/outdoor environments are carried out successfully using the newly developed measurement system consisting of three mobile robots named CPS-V. Generating a model of Dazaifu Tenmangu, a famous cultural heritage, for its digital archive completes the paper.},

There are a number of methods to estimate the remaining capacity of the robot's batteries. The accuracy of these approaches varies depending upon the chemical composition of the batteries as well as the means by which the monitoring is conducted. In this paper, an overview of various battery capacity estimation methodologies will be presented as well as a discussion of a specific implementation utilized on robotic platforms developed at the Center for Distributed Robotics at the University of Minnesota. This approach involves the novel use of fuel-gauging electronics for mobile robotic platforms. Experiments were conducted to show the accuracy of this method for both charge and discharge of the polymer Lithium-ion batteries in use.},

	Abstract = {We explore the interconnection between search and action in the context of mobile robotics. The task of searching for an object and then performing some action with that object is important in many applications. Of particular interest to us is the idea of a robot assistant capable of performing worthwhile tasks around the home and office (e.g., fetching coffee, washing dirty dishes, etc.). We prove that some tasks allow for search and action to be completely decoupled and solved separately, while other tasks require the problems to be analyzed together. We complement our theoretical results with the design of a combined search/action approximation algorithm that draws on prior work in search. We show the effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing it to state-of-the-art solvers, and we give empirical evidence showing that search and action can be decoupled for some useful tasks. Finally, we demonstrate our algorithm on an autonomous mobile robot performing object search and delivery in an office environment.},

	Abstract = {We propose a local Voronoi decomposition (LVD) algorithm which is able to perform a robust and online task allocation for multiple agents based purely on local information. Because only local information is required in determining each agent's Voronoi region, each agent can then make its decision in a distributive fashion based on its allocated Voronoi region. These Voronoi regions eliminates the occurrence of agents executing instantaneous overlapping tasks. As our method does not require a pre-processing of the map, it is also able to work well in a dynamically changing map with changing number of agents. We will show our proof of concept in the problem of exploration in an unknown environment. In our experimental evaluation, we show that our method significantly outperforms the competing algorithms: Ants algorithm and the Brick amp;Mortar algorithm. Our results also show that our method is near the theoretical best solution.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of communication range limitations for decentralized multi-vehicle mapping. We present a novel integrated communication and planning protocol that enables all vehicles to form a common global map. The fusion of mapping information is facilitated through the Information Filter and performed over a connected acyclic wireless communication network with limited communication range. The formation of the acyclic connected communication network is achieved by partitioning the landmark graph using graph theoretic tools during the planning phase. We provide results that illustrate the effectiveness of our approach over different distributions of landmarks.},

	Abstract = {We present a novel approach to compute collision-free paths for multiple robots subject to local coordination constraints. More specifically, given a set of robots, their initial and final configurations, and possibly some additional coordination constraints, our goal is to compute a collision-free path between the initial and final configuration that maintains the constraints. To solve this problem, our approach generalizes the social potential field method to be applicable to both convex and nonconvex polyhedra. Social potential fields are then integrated into a #x201C;physics-based motion planning #x201D; framework which uses constrained dynamics to solve the motion planning problem. Our approach is able to plan for over 200 robots while averaging about 110 ms per step in a variety of environments.},
