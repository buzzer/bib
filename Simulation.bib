  booktitle = {Robotics: Science and Systems VIII},

  abstract = {We propose a planning method for grasping in cluttered environments,
	a method where the robot can make simultaneous contact with multiple
	objects. With this method, the robot reaches for and grasps the target
	while simultaneously contacting and moving aside objects to clear
	a desired path. We use a physics-based analysis of pushing to compute
	the motion of each object in the scene in response to a set of possible
	robot motions. Our method enables multiple robot-object interactions,
	interactions that can be pre-computed and cached. However, our method
	avoids object-object interactions to make the problem computationally
	tractable. Through tests on large sets of simulated scenes, we show
	that our planner produces more successful grasps in more complex
	scenes than versions that avoid any interaction with surrounding
	clutter. We validate our method on a real robot, a PR2, and show
	that it accurately predicts the outcome of a grasp. We also show
	that our approach, in conjunction with state-of-the-art object recognition
	tools, is applicable in real-life scenes that are highly cluttered
	and constrained.},

	 In this paper we investigate the high-fidelity temporal projection
	of realistic robot behavior based on physics- and sensor-based simulation
	systems. We equip a simulator and interpreter with means to log simulated
	plan executions into a database. A logic-based query and inference
	mechanism then retrieves and reconstructs the necessary information
	from the database and translates the information into a first-order
	representation of robot plans and the behavior they generate. The
	query language enables the robot planning system to infer the intentions,
	the beliefs, and the world state at any projected time. It also allows
	the planning system to recognize, diagnose, and analyze various plan
	failures typical for performing everyday manipulation tasks. },

  abstract = {A method is described for the minimization of a function of n variables,
	which depends on the comparison of function values at the (n + 1)

	itself to the local landscape, and contracts on to the final minimum.
