  abstract = { Planning means deciding on the future course of action based on predictions
	of what will happen when an activity is carried out in one way or
	the other. As we apply action planning to autonomous, sensor-guided
	mobile robots with manipulators or even to humanoid robots we need
	very realistic and detailed predictions of the behavior generated
	by a plan in order to improve the robot's performance substantially.
	
	 In this paper we investigate the high-fidelity temporal projection
	of realistic robot behavior based on physics- and sensor-based simulation
	systems. We equip a simulator and interpreter with means to log simulated
	plan executions into a database. A logic-based query and inference
	mechanism then retrieves and reconstructs the necessary information
	from the database and translates the information into a first-order
	representation of robot plans and the behavior they generate. The
	query language enables the robot planning system to infer the intentions,
	the beliefs, and the world state at any projected time. It also allows
	the planning system to recognize, diagnose, and analyze various plan
	failures typical for performing everyday manipulation tasks. },
