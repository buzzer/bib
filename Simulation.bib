	Abstract = {We propose a planning method for grasping in cluttered environments,
	a method where the robot can make simultaneous contact with multiple
	objects. With this method, the robot reaches for and grasps the target
	while simultaneously contacting and moving aside objects to clear
	a desired path. We use a physics-based analysis of pushing to compute
	the motion of each object in the scene in response to a set of possible
	robot motions. Our method enables multiple robot-object interactions,
	interactions that can be pre-computed and cached. However, our method
	avoids object-object interactions to make the problem computationally
	tractable. Through tests on large sets of simulated scenes, we show
	that our planner produces more successful grasps in more complex
	scenes than versions that avoid any interaction with surrounding
	clutter. We validate our method on a real robot, a PR2, and show
	that it accurately predicts the outcome of a grasp. We also show
	that our approach, in conjunction with state-of-the-art object recognition
	tools, is applicable in real-life scenes that are highly cluttered
	and constrained.},

	robot similar abilities, we have built a robotic system that
	
	uses a perceptually-coupled physical simulator to produce
	
	an internal world model of the robot's environment. Real-
	
	time perceptual coupling ensures that the model is constantly
	
	kept in synchronization with the physical environment as the
	
	robot moves and obtains new sense data. This model allows
	
	the robot to be aware of objects no longer in its field of
	
	view (a form of ``object permanence''), as well as to visualize
	
	its environment through the eyes of the user by enabling
	
	virtual shifts in point of view using synthetic vision operating
	
	within the simulator. This architecture provides a basis for
	
	our long term goals of developing conversational robots that

	Abstract = {Simulators have played a critical role in robotics research as tools
	for quick and efficient testing of new concepts, strategies, and
	algorithms. To date, most simulators have been restricted to 2D worlds,
	and few have matured to the point where they are both highly capable
	and easily adaptable. Gazebo is designed to fill this niche by creating
	a 3D dynamic multi-robot environment capable of recreating the complex
	worlds that would be encountered by the next generation of mobile
	robots. Its open source status, fine grained control, and high fidelity
	place Gazebo in a unique position to become more than just a stepping
	stone between the drawing board and real hardware: data visualization,
	simulation of remote environments, and even reverse engineering of
	blackbox systems are all possible applications. Gazebo is developed
	in cooperation with the Player and Stage projects (Gerkey, B. P.,

	Abstract = { Planning means deciding on the future course of action based on predictions
	of what will happen when an activity is carried out in one way or
	the other. As we apply action planning to autonomous, sensor-guided
	mobile robots with manipulators or even to humanoid robots we need
	very realistic and detailed predictions of the behavior generated
	by a plan in order to improve the robot's performance substantially.
	
	 In this paper we investigate the high-fidelity temporal projection
	of realistic robot behavior based on physics- and sensor-based simulation
	systems. We equip a simulator and interpreter with means to log simulated
	plan executions into a database. A logic-based query and inference
	mechanism then retrieves and reconstructs the necessary information
	from the database and translates the information into a first-order
	representation of robot plans and the behavior they generate. The
	query language enables the robot planning system to infer the intentions,
	the beliefs, and the world state at any projected time. It also allows
	the planning system to recognize, diagnose, and analyze various plan
	failures typical for performing everyday manipulation tasks. },

@article{Nelder1965,
	Abstract = {A method is described for the minimization of a function of n variables,
	which depends on the comparison of function values at the (n + 1)
	vertices of a general simplex, followed by the replacement of the
	vertex with the highest value by another point. The simplex adapts
	itself to the local landscape, and contracts on to the final minimum.
	The method is shown to be effective and computationally compact.
	A procedure is given for the estimation of the Hessian matrix in
	the neighbourhood of the minimum, needed in statistical estimation
	problems.},
